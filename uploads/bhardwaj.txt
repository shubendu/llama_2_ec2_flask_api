off any longer, this is one of the things that we needed to deploy so just letting you know that I recreated your report in production.\nDhana Luna: So we tech we already have production, the reason why I didn't close it gets his because.\nDhana Luna: marca.\nDhana Luna: indicated that he might have additional updates to the report now that he has had.\nDhana Luna: A few days with it so once I

Luna: like this can you put it back into their pockets for me as.\nVishal Bhardwaj: soon.\nDhana Luna: As.\nDhana Luna: You get home, you can put into my name, so we can get out of it.\nVishal Bhardwaj: I think.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Also, the next trip on next ticket is about the update for skirt comes.\nVishal Bhardwaj: assume they might have been some confusion regarding the zip codes, so the file that we have uploaded already had the zip code in the in the file, and for that i've also opened our account, and you can see the zip code look up is all also updated.\nVishal Bhardwaj: As for the support.\nVishal Bhardwaj: In the file.\nDhana Luna: Can you go back to the.\nDhana Luna: comment from sun about.\nI said this was this was.\nDhana Luna: Okay.\nDhana Luna: All right, that's what I was going to offer so leaving that aside, there is another.\nDhana Luna: Come on, let me get this slide from Helen, so there is another believe, unfortunately, if not dived into.\nDhana Luna: Some of these tickets, but seven identify basically that popularity spore and customer segments.\num.\nDhana Luna: it's now possible okay.\nVishal Bhardwaj: And so.\nPlease.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so about the strategic manner, I mean customer segment and the Foster popularity school these two fields so we're also I mean.\nVishal Bhardwaj: I have to confirm about the popularity school, but the customer segment.\nVishal Bhardwaj: was not really there on this ticket, I mean on the files that were shared initially.\nVishal Bhardwaj: So.\nDhana Luna: But this is not the flower going on.\nVishal Bhardwaj: You can see the customer segment was not there, so that is why it was not uploaded initially, however, it was given in I mean in the.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Later phase of this update, so our own card was the one who was going to pick this as a silence.\nVishal Bhardwaj: reply.\nVishal Bhardwaj: I mean command, so let me just open the command as well.\nDhana Luna: So there must be a confusion, because there's a file that we've been updating, which is the one that we should be leveraging for the updates so there's a comment from me.\nDhana Luna: know.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Let me just open the come in, so this was the coming from Hong Kong, so he was going to pick the strategic management and the fsu popularity school.\nDhana Luna: which he did, but he is doing that, based off of the file that I provided and I updated so if you find my there's a comment on there, where I think the file, that we should be using for update.\nI believe.\nDhana Luna: I think it's below.\nDhana Luna: That one.\nDhana Luna: This one yeah.\nVishal Bhardwaj: So I guess this one was regarding the updating the owners of the account.\nDhana Luna: girl, and the file should wow.\nVishal Bhardwaj: This one does have the customer segment and foursquare popularity the witches ultimately the foursquare populating scope on salesforce.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so do you want us to update this, so we can take this in the morning and maybe by tomorrow if now having your morning tomorrow, you can get the state.\nDhana Luna: That works for me thank you.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so we'll pick this up and update the accounts.\nperfect.\nVishal Bhardwaj: So do we also need to update the account owners as well.\nDhana Luna: I believe, because there was a little bit of urgency around that if someone already took care of that.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Okay, so we'll check for that, if the account owners are not updated it so we'll take that up as go ahead.\nDhana Luna: All right, Okay, thank you.\nVishal Bhardwaj: So I think that is all about this ticket and about the onboarding record enhancement, this is still in today so i'll go to this ticket, as I was working on another ticket, so I didn't get time for this.\nDhana Luna: that's fine.\nVishal Bhardwaj: Just open this.\nVishal Bhardwaj: So this is the ongoing enhancements card, so I love work on this ticket and we'll get back to you with the initial questions that I have.\nDhana Luna: I think I think it sounds like.\nDhana Luna: A plan.\nOkay.\nDhana Luna: Sorry for the background noise.\nVishal Bhardwaj: I think it's fine it's not that much.\nVishal Bhardwaj: So the next ticket is about the asset collection from bugs so.\nVishal Bhardwaj: The hour I mean confirm from Philip confirm from Philip that this is going to take the changes
