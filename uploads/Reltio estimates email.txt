Subject: [Reltio] Request for Approval on Estimates for Enhancements

Hi Chris,

Trust you are doing well.

As per our discussion from last meeting, we have estimated the enhancements and divided them into three parts:

I. Automated Notification Enhancement for script failure 

Table


II. Additional Enhancements for the Dashboards and Data Clean Up

Table

III. Enhancements that are dependent on the access to identify scope and effort

Table

For YouTube Analytics dashboard, we required YouTube access for analysing data.
For Influenced Pipeline Revenue, we require below prerequisites to proceed further:
1. Create a copy of "Pipeline Attribution" prep flow with different output file name and dashboard with creator access for Sarabjot's id sarabjot.singh@grazitti.com.
2. Business Requirement understanding (why we are creating these reports?)
3. Do we need to integrate with any existing dashboards or into a new dashboard. If existing then which one?


Attaching a copy of estimate sheet as well.

Looking forward to your approval on points I and II above.
