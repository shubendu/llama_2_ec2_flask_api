"Allison Schauppner: How are you? Good\nSapna Chandra: good morning.\nKanak Garg: Good morning. How are you\nAllison Schauppner: doing? Well, how are you doing?\nKanak Garg: Doing? Great? Thank you so much. I hope that is also coming. So just give me a ticket. Let me just check with the team. Yeah, that team is here. Hey? Just Pete.\nJasbir Kaur: hey, Sebal. Hi, Alison\nJasbir Kaur: Nicholas Harder.\nKanak Garg: I think he is just joining so really, I guess Nickel has joined from both side of his time. If I'm not wrong. hey, Nicole? Yes, there you go.\nJasbir Kaur: Okay. No problem. Okay. Let me start with my ticket first.\nAllison Schauppner: Actually, we. We wanted to really quick. Just review a couple of things from our side. As far as our team goes. I don't know, Sabna, do you wanna give everyone the news\nSapna Chandra: so just wanted to let the team know. I actually accepted a new opportunity. With another home builder. And actually\nSapna Chandra: my last day with Try point will be next week on the first\nSapna Chandra: September, but just wanted to take this opportunity to to thank the team. And you know I've enjoyed working with all of you, and you know, obviously wish, the the team continued. You know success on your own, obviously. And then, you know, continued projects would try green as well.\nnikhil: Okay, that was kind of you can say mixed reaction kind of a news. So it was really you can say, nice working with you as well supplant to be honest. It's been you can say really nice journey with you.\nnikhil: Considering all the knowledge and all the things which you have shared so far, which is kind of a very fruitful for us, and which will definitely will be there looking forward to work with you.\nnikhil: Amazing work with you, with Subna once again. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nKanak Garg: Can you show authentic?\nAllison Schauppner: Yeah. And I think, just like over the next couple of weeks. We just wanna make sure that we're you know, if there are some\nAllison Schauppner: different responsibilities. You know that Santa is gonna be passing on to. Maybe you guys to help with us for us in the interim like creating, you know, programs and things like that that that she was doing?\nAllison Schauppner: So just be aware. And you know, we just need to keep things really structured for the time being, since we'll be down a a team member.\nnikhil: sure, completely. I listen like we'll be definitely top of it on everything. So do let me know. Like if any sort of an assistance is required from our side. If you want me to hop on a call on some you can say\nnikhil: or adult basis as well. So do let me know. I'll be accordingly available for the same\nAllison Schauppner: perfect thank you.\nnikhil: Perfect. So just be over to you.\nJasbir Kaur: Yeah, sure.\nJasbir Kaur: Alert\nJasbir Kaur: the first one from my side. banner image there.\nSapna Chandra: Yeah, that one looks really good. Thank you for your work on that one I saw that you added the drop down for them the fonts and\nSapna Chandra: so the divisions are able to toggle between the different phones that are available. And then we have that new the finalized assets first in terms of that header image and then the Logos as well. So thank you for that.\nJasbir Kaur: Yeah, I think that's completed from our end. If there will be anything updates from your end, just let us know we will do that?\nJasbir Kaur: Alright great. And the next one that you have edited in agenda is through a process\nJasbir Kaur: so yeah, do we have any update on that or just a regular, just to put it on everyone's radar, especially with my transition as well. I just wanted to make sure we have those top of mind. Just the quarterly one, that one. I know that one's coming up in early September.\nSapna Chandra: There, and then we have just the the 2 new audits that we've added as well in terms of the coming soon program. And then the the promo block people kick with. So yeah.\nJasbir Kaur: all right? Okay, no problem. We will do in the next month.\nJasbir Kaur: Alright, I think that's all from my end. Is there anything else for me?\nAllison Schauppner: I'm just here. I think that with some of the programs we do like on a monthly basis like our our content calendar and things like that.\nAllison Schauppner: If we were to ask you to build out those programs. It's like stuff. I can show you a if you want to share your screen, you can show her a\nAllison Schauppner: an example of one.\nSapna Chandra: Yeah, it's typically just a standard like an email, send program.\nSapna Chandra: Let me share my screen 1\xa0s.\nAllison Schauppner: But I think what we want to do is like you know, with the transition. And if.\nAllison Schauppner: since II won't be able to like build some of these programs out\nAllison Schauppner: just for time, for time. Constraints, reasons. if we were to submit a ticket to you and the team desperate, you know how many, how many days in advance do you need these?\nAllison Schauppner: The assets for them, like the copy and the instructions\nAllison Schauppner: in order to complete them\nJasbir Kaur: depend on the number of that you will get.\nSapna Chandra: Yeah, specifically, it would be just like one email send program so here's one example and it's done like on a monthly cadence. So the operation teams pretty much provides me like\nSapna Chandra: the the copy for for the email. So here's one that we recently did\nJasbir Kaur: Umhm.\nSapna Chandra: And I'll include just, you know, like your standard header, image copy, and then your your main call to action, which is generally we're linking it to a blog.\nJasbir Kaur: Paige\nSapna Chandra:  But the layout is pretty much.\nJasbir Kaur: I think. Then it will not take that much time if there will be only one email per pro per program. Yeah.\nJasbir Kaur: yeah, you you can just create a ticket for us. And I'll let you know the estimate. And the time over there.\nSapna Chandra: and in terms of like assets that you need. Do you need, like the the imagery size, like the copy, like? What? What are what are what is needed on your end.\nJasbir Kaur: Yeah, right? All the images and copied content.\nSapna Chandra: Okay.\nAllison Schauppner: do you need them? Do you need the images sized? Or can you size them on your end.\nJasbir Kaur: We can also try the major size at our end as well if you can. Share the high resolution images with us, or if you can just share the exact images that I think that would be also great.\nJasbir Kaur: Whatever is with you. Okay.\nAllison Schauppner: perfect.\nJasbir Kaur: Great.\nJasbir Kaur: Okay. All right. I think it's done from my end.\nAllison Schauppner: Great! Thank you, Jasper.\nnikhil: all right.\nnikhil: So let me just share my screen real quick.\nnikhil: Alright!\nnikhil: Sh! Let me just hide. Yep. alright.\nnikhil: so for like subno for encrypting email addresses. So like Aaron was asking for the email address list. So on which actually, like he can work around, or let's say he can share the encrypted email address list with you back after you know, using that particular code which you just shared with him.\nSapna Chandra: Right? And I think, I responded in the ticket, we don't really have a list right now to share. So can we create a test group like, you know, you can only include our email addresses. You know your, your team's email addresses just to test that code on it.\nnikhil: Okay? Sure. So just to test leads. Okay? So I think we just want to find out if it's possible or not. So it's at this point we don't have like an actual list to encrypt. Okay.\nnikhil: alright, so I'll work on it. And for most recent cui. So actually, I just had a word with the assets team who was working on it. So that is something which is not doable in the velocity scripting so like this is something like we have to do it at the campaign level itself. So either way around, like, we have to work on the smart campaign\nnikhil: goodness.\nnikhil: and for this community name. So I guess we were working on the lead object. So\nnikhil: assets team were not able to find the exact you can say lead object in which that particular field is been used.\nnikhil: So they were asking for the lead object.\nnikhil: From where we exactly have to, you know, use that particular field community marketing name.\nnikhil: so they were able to find out for the contact object. But they were not fine for the lead object. So if you can share that name of that object and the field which we have to select in that velocity script. So I guess that will be\nnikhil: most helpful for us to do.\nnikhil: Okay, I'll\nSapna Chandra: I'll take a look at that one. I'll send just to get you in the loop about that. That was kind of was for the one for that Site visit, follow up email. And with how we wanted\nSapna Chandra: to use the token, there's a the most recent site visit community. I think that was the what we were trying to figure out like what would be the best field, and it doesn't look like the most recent one that we previously talked about was going to be possible to use.\nAllison Schauppner: because there could have been a site visit in between the most recent one.\nSapna Chandra: Well, that, too, that could change. Yeah.\nnikhil:  hmm.\nAllison Schauppner: so what does it say right now? Do we know?\nSapna Chandra: Right now, I've just removed the token entirely. So it's just general copy, like. It's not specifying that the actual community they visited.\nAllison Schauppner: but it looks like they were. We do have this one. But it's pulling from the the contact record. So\nSapna Chandra: there may be people that may have a lead record. Right? So how do we? How would that work?\nAllison Schauppner: Yeah, I think this is probably a low priority right now, Nikhil, and I think that we should just\nAllison Schauppner: make it thanks for visiting tripoint homes, or thanks for signing up because we need to have salesforce put, put it on the lead in the contact record.\nnikhil: Okay, okay.\nnikhil: okay.\nAllison Schauppner: III would say, let's just bag it.\nnikhil: Okay.\nAllison Schauppner: let's just make sure that the assets just say tripoint homes for now.\nnikhil: Okay. got it.\nAllison Schauppner: Cause it hasn't worked. It hasn't worked right. It's ever worked.\nSapna Chandra: I don't think so? Yeah, I don't. I think it's not a priority. Let's just let's just remove it from the list of today's\nnikhil: okay. Sure. Thanks.\nnikhil: And for this coming soon program. So like, we have removed the choices like to choice Number 13, which we I already mentioned, noticet itself. So we have removed it. And in the case of like possible duplicates, we have to add the email addresses on first of September to that smart list that you know already shared as a link so definitely. So if are there any further actions after that? So like, for example, if we let's suppose, if we add\nnikhil: the email addresses to the smartest, so is there anything else up to that like we have to take care of? Or let's say you were taking care of. No, it was just exporting the the smart list and then adding it to that smart campaign, and then adding, The smart campaign is pretty much adding it to a static list. And then the division are using that static list to exclude.\nSapna Chandra: Okay, yeah.\nnikhil: okay, perfect.\nnikhil: And\nnikhil: for the room visualizer like Alison. They were working like they. The script was added only at the banner section, as of now, the section which you were exploring. At that moment the script wasn't there. So we have included this script on this particular section as well. So now you can do a testing. I did the testing on my end. Now it is working fine.\nnikhil: Got it? So I can. I can. And then we can push that to production. Yes, exactly. Okay. I'll test that today, and I'll let you know.\nnikhil: sure.\nnikhil: And after this, like for the custom, activity, vidyard tracking. So\nnikhil: I guess so when you were you can say out of office. So we had a discussion around it. Multiple times. So the thing is like, video activity is working only on the known leads. So far. So let's say, who is having a saved cookies onto their system.\nnikhil: Yeah, only for those leads. Video activity is currently working.\nnikhil: Okay? So I guess then we are good to go from the video perspective. Actually, the issue is like, when I was doing the testing, I was a new contact. So for me, sometimes it was working for some for my lead. It was. It wasn't working sometimes. So which was kind of a concerning you know situation for me to discuss first with you.\nAllison Schauppner: Why wasn't it? I'm sorry. Why wasn't it working\nnikhil: so actually on my system? The cookie wasn't saved at the very first place, because I was a new lead, who was trying to access the video ad activity. Or let's say, video. So which is where the leads were not. You know, the activity wasn't tracking for my lead on some of the pages.\nnikhil: But what website team has done the R. And D on their end is kind of a thing like\nnikhil: the activities being dragged only for those particular leaves whom for whom the cookies already saved.\nnikhil: Ok. Or let's say, who is who is actually a known lead.\nAllison Schauppner: I think that's okay, Nikhil, because this is for lead scoring, remember. So if if the person's not a lead. Yet we have nowhere to put a score\nnikhil: right? Okay? So I think that's okay.\nnikhil: Yeah. So which is what the cases we just wanted to let you know around it. Yeah. So was there any work that needed to be done for this custom activity? Because I do feel like we already had that set up right.\nnikhil: Yes, that is completely set up, and also I went through your vidyard account as well. So everything is set up over there as well. Everything is correctly set up, so I guess. Everything is up and running.\nAllison Schauppner: and we have it in our lead score, right and everything.\nnikhil: Yes, on both ends production and sandbox on both sides.\nAllison Schauppner: Got it?\nnikhil: Yep. and we shared one document with you as well about this Ballpark estimates about custom object audit. Yes.\nnikhil: So\nnikhil: the ours right now. It is mentioned only for marketer side. We haven't included the salesforce side hours, because we don't have an access to a salesforce account. So so which is why it is coming out to be, let's say, approximately up to 50\xa0h. But\nnikhil: what I can see the utilization will be lesser than 50. So it is most up to like. We have included everything like, you know, every single look and corner, or, let's say, any sort of an additional request as well. So it is only for the documentation side. The implementation, as will be different, because, obviously like this is, firstly, we are trying to document the things.\nnikhil: and this will be including all the information that you have asked for. Let's say, dependency, and how exactly the project plan will be step by process, and where exactly the object has been used, and how exactly we will purge it, and we will replace it. So everything will be there in this particular documentation.\nAllison Schauppner: Okay.\nAllison Schauppner: yeah. Let me review that. I did see that you did this. Thank you. So are you thinking it's like with just the market size. W. What did it come to like? 60\xa0h, or something? 50 or 60\xa0h?\nnikhil: Yes, this is what I'm estimating. So actual hours will be lesser than that. That is 100%. Yeah.\nAllison Schauppner: okay, yeah.\nnikhil:  after that.\nnikhil: One more thing. Yes, for the person source. Actually, we were. I need to discuss this thing with you as well. So I'm still having no information on these particular leads like, how exactly have to assign these leads as a person source.\nnikhil: So entrust list, confirmation. So these are around 18 leads that I need to fix\nAllison Schauppner: interestless confirmation. What is that?\nnikhil: We discuss about this earlier as well like, Alison like this is something which is coming up as a campaign name. And\nnikhil: the campaign source is empty. Let me just see if I can open it\nnikhil:  the\nnikhil: yeah. so it's activity\nnikhil:  yeah.\nnikhil: that phone yeah.\nnikhil: here, it is\nAllison Schauppner: pearl.\nAllison Schauppner: Can you scroll the other way?\nAllison Schauppner: What is interestless confirmation? I don't even know what that is\nnikhil: either way like, based on this details. What I can see either we can assign. Let's a direct website or lets say, outreach outreach email.\nAllison Schauppner: marketo, email, slash. Lp, what is that\nnikhil: email landing page?\nAllison Schauppner: And I see the whole form. URL.\nnikhil: Yeah, sure.\nnikhil:  do you see, Metro, send out an email that\nAllison Schauppner: Ask people to join an interest list?\nAllison Schauppner: Prisolis?\nHmm.\nSapna Chandra: yeah.\nnikhil: listen to the chat, Madison.\nnikhil: but I guess this is from every different division. I guess so. It's from DC. Metro as well than Inland Empire. San Diego.\nnikhil: Dallas\nAllison Schauppner: Nikol. This is new, right? We haven't seen this before.\nnikhil: Yes, this is new.\nnikhil: this, and this is also like 7, 1, 8, 7, 5, 8 2. So this is also something which is new.\nAllison Schauppner: I don't know what this is.\nnikhil: Hmm.\nnikhil: so actually, which is why, actually, I'm documenting on every you know, single on monthly basis.\nnikhil: and I can't even ignore these leads as well, because these are kind of a valid leads.\nnikhil: Hmm.\nAllison Schauppner: and this has the person source missing. Right? Yes. Okay. Can you send me this list? Can you send me the URL for this?\nnikhil: Thank you. I'll have to keep looking into it. I don't know what that is.\nnikhil: Sure. No problem.\nnikhil: Sorry. Sorry. Actually, I just I guess I just re share the same. Yolanda. My keyboard actually is not working\nnikhil: the\nnikhil: I have to do it. You know, old school methods in here. Yeah, this is\nnikhil: so right now. Like Alison, like we are ignoring these leads as of now. Okay, so we are trying to fix other leads which are fixable\nnikhil: so which we are well versed with like, we have to fix that. So we are, you know, attributing them accordingly. But these leaves we are ignoring as of now. Okay, so we are. We are not assigning any sort of person. Source. Yeah, let me take a look at that\nnikhil: chip. So I guess. These were all the pointers from my side. I listen. So is there anything else like you want to? Highlight?\nnikhil: Yeah. Let me look at here, let me share my screen.\nAllison Schauppner: I'm looking at one for the video tracking.\nnikhil: So\nAllison Schauppner: and I'm not seeing So all I'm seeing is like that the person score changes for video views.\nnikhil: But I'm not seeing like, you know how it says like\nAllison Schauppner: 0 to 0 to Oh, here it is\nAllison Schauppner: here. Okay, this is what I want.\nAllison Schauppner: So like, you can see that this, the video views here.\nnikhil: it's like 025-50-7500.\nnikhil: Yep.\nAllison Schauppner: So that's what I kind of want to score I want to score based off of the intervals like, so if they only watch 25%,\nnikhil: score them with a point if they watched it for 50.\nAllison Schauppner: Well, you know what I mean?\nnikhil: Yeah, yeah, completely. So I can create the campaign accordingly. A test campaign for you, and you can take a review of it, and then accordingly, like we can push it, live or external leads as well.\nAllison Schauppner: Yeah, I think that that's what I want to do. So it could, we can see the activity. Right?\nnikhil: Yeah, we can. We can. So wherever like, the leaves are qualifying for this, you can say\nnikhil: this video views. So we are getting this detail as well. So definitely, we can change the score accordingly. Just you can say, just let me know what exactly the score you want to assign based on, based on the percentage. Accordingly, I can do it.\nAllison Schauppner: Okay.\nAllison Schauppner: that's perfect. So yeah, okay, so the video. So if I'm going, let's just do it right now. So we're going to\nnikhil:  video views.\nnikhil: type video, I guess in chat, I guess that'll quick access.\nnikhil: Yeah.\nnikhil: video views, plus one\nnikhil: 0 7.\nAllison Schauppner: Yeah. So\nAllison Schauppner: plus 3 for more than 50 plus one for 0 7. So I don't know. I like why I am not showing that this is what's happening.\nnikhil: Okay?\nAllison Schauppner: You know what I mean.\nnikhil: Yep.\nnikhil: So you want to make the changes to let's say the one which I created like a video view video plus 3, or to the video, vo vue video plus one\nAllison Schauppner: right here. So I want it to be if it's if they watched less than 50.\nAllison Schauppner: Give them plus one. If they watch more than 50, give them plus 3.\nnikhil: Okay? Done. I'll do it.\nAllison Schauppner: Okay. I don't think that's a hard change, right?\nnikhil: No, no, not at all. So it's simply like we have to add the constraint like person viewed\nAllison Schauppner: first interview. Oh, here. Oh, perfect. Oh, that's easy. Okay.\nnikhil: yeah.\nAllison Schauppner: yeah.\nnikhil: Yep.\nAllison Schauppner: Do I need this web page? I don't need this, do I?\nnikhil: You can keep it as an ex but it's a trigger. No, you can remove it. I guess\nnikhil: it's okay. You can keep it the second one.\nnikhil: Yes, yeah, this much.\nnikhil: But I guess you added the greater than 50 to the wrong company. Yeah, less than 50. Okay, so that's d10, cool. Okay, so this should actually be done now.\nnikhil: right? Exactly perfect. Hmm. yeah. So apart from this, like anything else like\nAllison Schauppner: there was one other area that I wanted to show you. I have this person here, and I don't know how to figure this out. I need your help.\nAllison Schauppner: Where does that person go?\nAllison Schauppner: Well, let me just do one thing. First, I don't wanna lose my spot here, hold on 1\xa0s.\nAllison Schauppner: there was this person.\nAllison Schauppner: okay. you know in our engaging accelerated programs.\nnikhil: Yep.\nAllison Schauppner:  it's like added to Tri transcript. And then transcript is completed or in progress.\nAllison Schauppner: I don't know how this person. So what's happening is there's with our Nhs is they get tasks. If someone moves to. Mql.\nnikhil: okay.\nAllison Schauppner: if someone moves to Mq. L. And they and they have a community of interest, and they'll get a normal priority task. Well, this person was recycled, and then they moved to Mq. L. But I don't know how they're getting to to Mq. L. Here\nAllison Schauppner: because\nAllison Schauppner: it should have, after the chat started. moved directly to Nhs. Qualified.\nAllison Schauppner: and then it shouldn't have triggered this task. So what's happening is, he's he's chatting with the person the Nhs is chatting with the person, and he's getting sent to another task.\nnikhil: Okay.\nnikhil: got it? Got it.\nAllison Schauppner: and I can't figure out why\nnikhil: so ideally this should be like if somebody is if I'm understanding it correctly, correct me if I'm wrong. So if\nnikhil: added to Chat transcript activities there, then, directly it should be like Nhs qualified right rather than assigning it as an Mq. Chat is answered. Even if chat is unanswered, it still gets marked as Nhs qualifying. So that's why we have like\nnikhil: engage accelerated with, missed in progress and completed\nAllison Schauppner: to just for that to be Nhs qualified, however, or sorry. Nhs, sorry if it's\nAllison Schauppner: missed, completed, or in progress, we would say Nhs engaged.\nnikhil: No engage accelerated\nAllison Schauppner: would be the the campaign success.\nAllison Schauppner: When someone goes to engage accelerated, it gets plus 50, which would ultimately, if someone was recycled, it would move them back to Mql.\nAllison Schauppner: Because ql. Gets triggered by the points, but the person should have been not empty. Well, that should have been Nhs\nnikhil: qualified, qualified.\nAllison Schauppner: So I'm trying to figure out, how do I? How do I not allow it to change the to Mq. L. Just let the automation work to Ni just qualified.\nNo, but\nnikhil: okay. Then I guess I have to review the campaigns.\nnikhil: because then only I can. You know, I can share the exclusion criteria with you. In that case, yeah, because right now, what I can see is like based on the activity, or, let's say, based on some sort of a campaign qualification criteria. The lead has been qualified to this lead life cycle 0 3 Mql. Campaign, and which is why the status is assigned as an Mq. And after the Mql. The status was assigned us, and it just qualified. So\nnikhil: I have to see that how I can bypass this particular campaign\nnikhil: so that the flow step should get skipped for that particular lead.\nAllison Schauppner: Yeah. And I think it's okay to let them go to Mq. L. But then, also because it but because it's going to Mq. L. Is like, it's triggering this task. So what we could do\nAllison Schauppner: is maybe do a filter on the normal priority tasks that says.\nAllison Schauppner:  you know.\nnikhil: or maybe make a smart list to control it, to say, you know, if they had a chat transcript today.\nAllison Schauppner: remove from flow.\nnikhil: Oh.\nnikhil: yes, I guess that is also something which is doable. Because if you don't, if you are okay with it, let's say, marking them lead as an MQL. Then I guess we have to include\nnikhil: the exclusion step in this normal task.\nnikhil: Campaigns like\nnikhil: added to Chen Chat Transcript\nnikhil: is not there for this lead, right? We can include them as an exclusion list in here.\nAllison Schauppner: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I'm trying to clean these up. Let's only work on La Las Vegas team is really good\nnikhil: cause. There was another issue. I found\nAllison Schauppner: that was happening with a form bill.\nAllison Schauppner: So what's ha! What was happening was someone was moving from recycle to Mq. L.\nAllison Schauppner: The normal priori. Sorry I'm reading my whiteboard because I wrote down the normal priority task got triggered.\nAllison Schauppner: but the person filled out the form, the pge form, and then asked back and and and\nAllison Schauppner: in October of 2022. So what happened was\nnikhil: they? They triggered for the task\nnikhil: based off of moving from recycle to Mq. All this other person right?\nnikhil: The same scenario. It's recycled Mql. So they triggered.\nAllison Schauppner: They had a community of interest\nAllison Schauppner: they not like, they still qualify for all of these items. Once they got to the flow.\nAllison Schauppner: because it says.\nAllison Schauppner: filled out form\nnikhil: right?\nAllison Schauppner:  one of these forms call on\nAllison Schauppner: the high priority task.\nnikhil: but because the person filled out the form back in October\nnikhil: they still call down the form. It's still calling for the high priority task.\nAllison Schauppner: So they go to the high priority which isn't accurate. It should just have gone through the normal priority test because they went from basically recycled Mq based off the form fell.\nnikhil: Actually, no, they didn't. They went off based off of a\nAllison Schauppner: based off of a the scoring change. Actually they, they were recycled. And then they went back to Mq. L. Because of activity they had then\nAllison Schauppner: so then this one called the High priority task. Remove them from this flow.\nnikhil: Once they got to the high priority task, though.\nnikhil: we have here that says.\nnikhil: Yeah.\nnikhil: they had to fill out the form today.\nAllison Schauppner: So they didn't qualify.\nnikhil: Okay, so what I think we should do\nAllison Schauppner: is. let's let's create like a full. I'm gonna create a folder for, like all the smart lists we're using to control these.\nnikhil: And\nAllison Schauppner: I'm just gonna say, fill that form today. If they're a member of this smart list.\nAllison Schauppner: we would remove them from the normal priority task flow. Send them to the high priority. If they are in a number of this because they didn't fill it out today. Then let them through the flow. Right?\nnikhil: Yeah. So I'm gonna I think that's the best way to do it. What do you think\nnikhil: exactly so, I guess. You know, using the smart list as an exclusion. I guess that is the best way to do it. Otherwise, like, you know we have to include multiple criterias in the campaign list that will, you know, confuse the entire campaign. So I think it should be if member of smartlist in that fill that form, send to that priority task and then remove them from flow. If they were a part of that\nnikhil: right? Exactly. I think I'm gonna I'm gonna make that change on the these.\nnikhil: Sure, if you can. If you can assign us this one, I can do it. Do that as well. So nothing like a big deal. So we can work on it. So just you can just create this particular ticket, and we can take it from there as well.\nnikhil: Yep.\nnikhil: alright.\nnikhil: So anything else like Alison.\nAllison Schauppner: Hmm. yeah. So for the period costs, I know that we have\nAllison Schauppner: with step. No leaving. I really need presidents help to cause we have a so\nAllison Schauppner: let me go back. We have a reoccurring\nAllison Schauppner:  report that gets sent to the division teams every month on the seventh right?\nnikhil: So if for some reason we don't have those period costs in there.\nAllison Schauppner: the report won't be correct. So I really need presidents help to keep keep track of, you know, if we need. You know, period cost added from the divisions, if we need them from assembly like in order for that report to be correct.\nnikhil: So is there a way that you guys could do like every month on the sixth.\nAllison Schauppner: There's like you. You send me an email confirmation, saying that all the period costs for every channel have been done.\nnikhil: If if there's not, you know if we're missing some period costs.\nAllison Schauppner: because the divisions haven't filled it out, or to assembly hasn't provided them yet.\nnikhil: you know I need to know so that I can. I can reach out to them, because just it's going to be too hard for me to track with everything else going on. So I'm I'm looking to Grezidi's help to help manage that\nnikhil: sure definitely. So if you want like me to, you can say, put a follow up message as well to Stephanie on monthly basis. So I can do that as well. So definitely we can take care of as much as things as we can definitely handle a lot of loads of yours so definitely, we'll happy to, you know. Take a take that up so not a big deal. Just send me a follow up email versus in a sonic. Just so I can see it cause a lot of times get lost.\nnikhil: Sure, no problem. In that case, I'll I'll keep a track of it paraly, and maybe aligning some more folks as well, just to keep the things aligned, and on top of it on every single ticket. So definitely, we'll add a periodic follow up to you.\nAllison Schauppner: Alright.\nAllison Schauppner: The other one other thing is this body bird parameters.\nAllison Schauppner: This ticket was submitted by Sapna, and we had this new campaign. So wait for paid search, paid display, and paid social.\nnikhil: We have a new campaign called\nAllison Schauppner: Bobby Burke, and for each division. So if it's Bobby Burke paid search.\nAllison Schauppner: we need, we need to create\nAllison Schauppner: If you could create an example for each, let's say, for\nAllison Schauppner: each division. So if you wanna if you want to create one for Arizona, display one for Arizona, for paid search, one for Arizona, for which we'll call it paid paid social.\nnikhil: That would be great. So what it would be is, basically you're just going to clone this. So\nAllison Schauppner: oops. It's gonna say.\nAllison Schauppner: okay.\nAllison Schauppner: And then for display, obviously, we're just gonna change that campaign name from, you know, awareness or whatever to that Arizona Bobby Burke.\nnikhil: Sure completely we can do the setup of that, and I'll share the initial campaign setup with you. Just take a quick review, and if any sort of updates required. Do let me know.\nAllison Schauppner: Okay, so I'm gonna say, marking.\nnikhil: So it should be for let's say, paid social paid advertising and paid search right.\nnikhil: alright perfect! We'll do that.\nAllison Schauppner: There's like that. Yep.\nnikhil: yep.\nAllison Schauppner: perfect. And then, if you could just give me a estimate on how you know what the completion. Time would be.\nnikhil: I guess it will be done by Monday end of the day. Probably not more than that, I mean, I mean for the whole project. What would it? How many hours would it cost for the whole project\nnikhil: for this campaign? Creation? Right?\nnikhil: So I guess it won't take like more than 5\xa0min per campaign.\nAllison Schauppner: Okay.\nnikhil: yeah. So I guess that will be it.\nnikhil: Because I'll be reviewing. Let's say randomly few of the campaigns, and I'll be giving you the updates accordingly. So we'll make sure, like to complete within, let's say, 5\xa0min of timeline per campaign. So we'll share. We'll share the final hours with you after that. So it means 5\xa0min per campaign. You can consider it as\nAllison Schauppner: okay.\nnikhil: Alright.\nAllison Schauppner: Yep, that works. Okay. So like, yeah, you'll see here. I'm just doing this one with you right now.\nnikhil: Sure.\nAllison Schauppner: I don't. Do. We need this, I guess. Maybe\nAllison Schauppner: so. This one doesn't look like we have campaign, the call description in in Bobby Burke or for Arizona's display stuff. This is one we we actually do need to clean the displays up again\nAllison Schauppner: the the the we're not tracking the call description. Correctly.\nnikhil: Okay.\nAllison Schauppner: So if we were to go to display awareness\nnikhil: and also, like Allison, I guess. I just wanted to ask this one. So like, should we delete the Batch campaigns like which we are creating to fix the person source.\nAllison Schauppner: I mean, I don't like having the batches here, but I mean\nAllison Schauppner: I I'd like to clean this up if they're not being used. I mean, if they have been used in the past. That's fine. But if they're not being used or were never run just delete.\nnikhil: Okay? Okay?\nnikhil: Because actually, I am also creating on daily, on monthly basis, let's say, every single time a new version of it so. and some of the channels, like the badge campus, are around 10 or 11.\nnikhil: So I was thinking about to delete them.\nAllison Schauppner: Oh, why, why are you doing that?\nnikhil: So actually? Well, while fixing the lead is actually, I need to create the Batch campaign right? So that ideally, it should, you know, assign the person source in an ideal way.\nnikhil: So which is why so? I was creating that Batch campaigns every single time a different one. I wasn't running the existing one reason is the same thing like, you know. I'm not sure like whether the lead will be assigned the person source correctly.\nnikhil: So that is what the case is.\nAllison Schauppner: Okay.\nnikhil: yeah. So like.\nAllison Schauppner: can you show me where that where you're doing that II just wanna make sure that you're I mean, we're not. You're not having to do this. I mean, we should be fixing the campaigns versus like having to run batches for them.\nnikhil: Yeah, just give me 1\xa0s.\nnikhil: Let's say if I'll talk about manual entry\nnikhil: 1\xa0s\nnikhil: to\nnikhil: that position.\nnikhil: 9, 1 19.\nnikhil: So like in here, you can see this one.\nnikhil: So what I am trying to say is like I should delete these particular campaigns reason is the same thing because these were the badge campaigns. We tried to fix the leads, and now that leads are fixed so like we can delete them. So can I see one of the engage accelerated campaigns?\nnikhil: Yeah, sure.\nlet's say this one.\nnikhil: So it's kind of a similar setup. So, which is already as a trigger campaign setup is there\nnikhil: so simply like we are creating a Batch campaign outfit, and then we are running it on new leads.\nnikhil: Whatever is getting added to that person's source, fix smart list\nAllison Schauppner: okay, go to flow.\nnikhil:  how do we know their their manual entry.\nnikhil: so actually, we are cross, checking from the source itself. So, for example, if somebody is from salesforce.com, the lead is created from salesforce.com, and Sftc type is lead, but person source is empty. So on that basis, we are identifying the leads. Also, whenever we are creating a batch campaign leads are automatically qualifying for this Batch campaign. So we are cross, verifying for that lead as well.\nnikhil: Can I see one real quick? Yeah. Sure. So, for example, if these are the leads.\nnikhil: Let me see if I can showcase you\nnikhil: So these are all the agents one. So let me see if I can.\nnikhil: I guess these are all new leads which are right now present in you can say that\nnikhil: missing. Yeah. So these are all agents right now. So if you can see like original sources from the salesforcecom. Okay, so\nnikhil: let me open one of these.\nnikhil: I mean.\nnikhil: so you can see like sources from salesforce.com and SFDC type is contacting\nAllison Schauppner: and nothing else.\nnikhil: nothing else.\nAllison Schauppner: Oh, gosh, okay, yeah. I guess that's right.\nnikhil: Yeah, really. So\nnikhil: so I was asking for these particular campaigns like, should we delete? Because this is like, you know, just you can say, lowering down the speed of your instance, anyway? Why don't you just have one? Why don't you just have one and then run it\nnikhil: so in the existing one you are trying to say like we should run rerun this Batch campaign on every single time. Right? Yeah. Why do you have? You don't need multiple.\nnikhil: So actually, the reason is the same thing. Actually, I tried this particular approach as well. At that moment lead wasn't qualified for the Batch campaign for the existing Batch campaign, or for some of the reason, like flow step was skipped for that particular lead. So I just wanted to be double sure, like leads are getting assigned the right person source, which is why I was creating these particular separate campaigns.\nnikhil: otherwise like, there is no such of requirement. But\nnikhil: just to be double short, like everything is set up correctly. which is what the case is.\nAllison Schauppner: Okay.\nnikhil: Now.\nAllison Schauppner: I mean, you know, yeah, I think you can. Only you can just use one if you wanted.\nnikhil: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I can do it.\nAllison Schauppner: Thank you. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you for all your help.\nnikhil: Thank you. Thank you so much, Edison. Thank you so much up now. It was really nice working with you once again. Thank you. Thank you so much.
